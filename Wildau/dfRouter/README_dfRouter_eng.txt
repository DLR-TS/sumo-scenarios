dfRouter

The dfrouter works in a similar way to the flowRouter, but it is straightened of routes.
Similar to the flowRouter, the dfrouter needs a detector file ("detectors.xml"), which creates "virtual" loops with the counting data.
The individual parameters for the dfRouter are defined and executed in a batch file ("dfRouter.bat").
 
After the batch file has been executed, an output file can be generated again, where by the output file of the routes must be specified by the dfrouter as a route file.
The data in the file can then be transferred to the Excel table.
