Create pedestrians and bicycles

RandomTrips can be used to create randomly generated pedestrian and bicycles routes.
The batch files ("randomTripsped.bat and randomByc.bat") were executed for this purpose. Different output files are generated, where by the route files in particular are "interesting".
This can be transferred to the configuration file.

Important: The time span that is set for randomTrips must match the time span of the configuration file.
