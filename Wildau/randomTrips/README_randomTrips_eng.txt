randomTrips

SUMO has the tool randomTrips, which randomly generates routes within a network. The whole thing is called in a batch file ("randomTrips.bat").
Inland and transit traffic can be weighted using the fringe factor. Ever higher the number is more transit traffic will be generated.
"P" stands for the period which indicates how often vehicles are "created". Ever smaller the period is  more vehicles are produced.
The two factors can be adjusted until the simulation appears realistic.

An output file can then be created, where by the routes generated by the tool must be specified as a route file.
