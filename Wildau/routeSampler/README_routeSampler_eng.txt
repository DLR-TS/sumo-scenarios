routeSampler

If the appearance of the result of randomTrips plausible, the routeSampler can be used.
The counting data can be linked to the routes generated.
First, however, an output file must be generated again ("edgedata-file_Wildau" already present in this example).
This file contains the counting data that are to be reached. For this purpose, the edges that had no counting data were deleted.
The sampler tries to use the routes to reach the counting data of the individual edges.
The routeSampler can be called in the same batch file ("routeSampler.bat").

At the same time, a separate output file is generated by the sampler and with the aid of the optimize call, the generation is optimized.
The results of the sampler can now be generated and compared via a new output file, with the routes in the sampler's <Output_File>.
It is advisable to write down the collected results of the output data in an Excel table.

Note: If the desired counting data cannot be achieved by the routeSampler or if there are large deviations, it is advisable to generate more route alternatives with the help of randomTrips.
The assumption is that the routeSampler needs a certain amount of demand / routes in order to achieve the desired count values.
