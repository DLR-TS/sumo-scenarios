Create pedestrians

RandomTrips can be used to create randomly generated pedestrian routes.
The batch file ("randomTripsped.bat") is executed for this purpose. 3 output files are generated, where by the route file in particular is "interesting".
This can be transferred to the configuration file.

Important: The time span that is set for randomTrips must match the time span of the configuration file.
